# tbRPG
A turn-based RPG similar to the classics I used to play like *Final Fantasy*. The player will be able to control 3 player-characters, each representing a different class with unique skills, and fight off a wave of randomly generated monsters.

Code and Code Design
1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

I would have structured my code to have less global variables for ease of manipulation. The initial CSS was also a mess because I was still learning the ropes.

2. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

I quite like the solution I came up with for firing skills. I think I implemented generating monsters in a very scaleable way - it SHOULD be easy to add planned features in the future.  
For each, please include code examples.

1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.
